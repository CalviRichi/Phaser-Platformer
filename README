Platformer Project - Calvin Richards, Keyan Premji

LAYERS: 
    ground, background, decoration, hazard, object
    Tile size of 18px

Every tile can have its own properties, for instance in Tiled you can select some spikes and give them
the special property "damage" which you can then read in phaser. Objects have their own special values.

SCENES:
    Start, Playing, End 

PLAYER MOVEMENT:
    Acceleration for holding direction, eventual max speed
    press space to jump, that needs acceleration too

SPECIAL GAME MECHANICS: gravity switching and moving platforms! Will there be enemies? If so then there should be 
attacking mechanics, jumping on their heads? powerups like fire flower in mario?

Should use animations, will figure out more after the "juice" lecture. 
There will probably be keys and things to unlock, like wall jumping. 

FILE LAYOUT:
    player.js handles all player functions, that means it will receive flags
    movement, health management, etc...
